<title>Environmental Demo</title>
<p>Just like pipeline stages, environment setups vary. The following setup is common:
    <ul>
        <li>dev: a development-only place for adding new code, kept locally on a developer's computer</li>
        <li>test: a testing-only place for verifying that code is good enough to publish, hosted on a private server</li>
        <li>prod: the live "production" version of a product, hosted online for users to see</li>
    </ul>
